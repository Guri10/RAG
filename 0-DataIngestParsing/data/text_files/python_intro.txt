Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely 
used for various applications such as web development, scientific 
computing, and data analysis. Created in the late 1980s by Guido van 
Rossum, Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, 
making it an ideal language for beginners and experts alike.

Python's syntax is concise and intuitive, with a focus on code 
readability. It has a vast standard library that includes modules for 
tasks such as file I/O, networking, and data structures. The language also 
supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and 
inheritance.
