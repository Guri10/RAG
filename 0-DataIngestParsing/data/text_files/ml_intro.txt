Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables 
systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It 
involves training algorithms on large datasets to enable them to make 
predictions, classify patterns, or make decisions on their own. The goal 
of machine learning is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tasks 
such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive 
modeling. Machine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into 
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with its unique 
approach to data-driven decision-making. It has numerous applications in 
areas like computer vision, robotics, and healthcare.
